The project collects voices in the form of censored/erased (permission denied) text from Weibo via the platform called [weiboscope](weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/), developed by Dr. Fu, King Wa from Hong Kong University .

The custom-software presents the erased sentences in the form of character by character, and the duration of each 'tweet' is subjected to the original visibility, in which the time is calculated from subtracting erased/censored time and created/posted time on Weibo. 

Technically, it uses python to do the web scraping with limited data available (only past 7 days, max 200 records), and the piece is written in p5.js. 

*still in a fine-tuning stage*
