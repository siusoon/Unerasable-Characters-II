*Unerasable Characters II: A fast forward illustration on how tweets are disappeared online*

[RUNME](https://siusoon.github.io/UnerasableCharactersII/code/)

The project explores the temporality of erasure and politics of voices. As part of the series Unerasable Characters, this web-based custom-software presents the erased 'tweets' from the Chinese Social Media Platform Weibo in a grid format, in which each tweet is further broken down into character-by-character display. The duration of each 'tweet' is computed and translated from the original visibile time online, which is calculated from subtracting erased/censored time and created/posted time on Weibo. 

The project collects voices in the form of censored/erased (permission denied) text from Weibo via the platform called [weiboscope](weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/), developed by Dr. Fu, King Wa from Hong Kong University .Technically, it uses python to do the web scraping with limited data available (only past 7 days, max 200 records), and the piece is written in p5.js.
