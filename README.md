The project collects data from censored/erased (permission denied) data from Weibo via the platform called weiboscope weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/.

The custom-software presented the erased data and the duration of each 'tweet' is subjected to the original visibility, in which the time is calculated from the substraction between erased/censored time and created/posted time on Weibo. 

Technically, it uses python to do the web scraping with limited data available (only past 7 days, max 200 records), and the piece is written in p5.js. 

*still in a fine-tuning stage*
